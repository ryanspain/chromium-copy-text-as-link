# Privacy Policy

Last updated: September 14, 2025

Copy Text as Link (the "Extension") is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, transmit, or sell any personal information or browsing data.

## What data we collect

- None. The Extension does not collect any user data whatsoever.

## How the Extension works

- All functionality runs locally in your browser to generate links based on the page you are viewing and the text you select.
- The Extension does not send any data to external servers.
- The generated links are copied to your clipboard only at your explicit request.

## Permissions explained

The Extension requests minimal permissions required for its core features:

- `contextMenus`: Used to add rightâ€‘click menu items to trigger copying links.
- `storage`: Used only to save your local preferences/options for the Extension. These settings are stored locally by your browser and are not transmitted to us.

## Third parties

- The Extension does not integrate with analytics, advertising, or tracking services.
